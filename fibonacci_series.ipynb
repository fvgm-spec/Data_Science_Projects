    "Fibonacci series is one of the most common algorithms studied by beginner programmers, as it is a way to implement the recursion method in any of the most used programming languages.\n",

    "Fibonacci series is nothing else than a sequence of numbers where the $n_{th}$ term is the sum of the previous two terms in that series of mumbers.\n",

    "In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted a $Fn$, forms a sequence of numbers, called the _Fibonacci sequence_, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Outside India, the Fibonacci sequence first appears in the book [Liber Abaci](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_abaci) (The Book of Calculation, 1202) by Leonardo de Pisa, AKA Fibonacci, where this sequence was used to calculate the growth of rabbit populations.\n",

    "## The enigma of rabbits\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, Fibonacci is better known for the discovery of some numbers, now called the Fibonacci sequence, which arose when he tried to solve an enigma about rabbit mating habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a farmer has a pair of rabbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbits take two months to reach maturity, and after that they give birth to another pair of rabbits every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was how to know how many pairs of rabbits would have been in a given month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    " *  During the 1st month you have a pair of rabbits and, as they have not matured, they can not reproduce.\n",
    " *  During the 2nd month, there is still a single pair.\n",
    " *  But at the beginning of the 3rd month, the first couple reproduces for the first time, so there are 2 pairs of rabbits.\n",
    " *  At the beginning of the 4th month, the first pair is reproduced again, but the second pair is not mature enough, so there are 3 pairs.\n",
    " *  In the 5th month, the first pair is reproduced and the second pair is played for the first time, but the third pair is still very young, so there are 5 pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image2](img/rabbits.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ritual of mating continues, but what you will notice soon is that the number of rabbit couples you have in a given month is the sum of the rabbit couples you have had in each of the two previous months, so the sequence continues, because in the ilustration for the 5th month, will be able to mate, the yellow, green and purple pairs of rabbits, so the sequence continues with 8, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1... 1... 2... 3... 5... 8... 13... 21... 34... 55... and so on.**"

    "### Code to generate Fibonacci series\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python [web site](https://www.python.org/) you can find one of the ways to generate Fibonacci series by coding, find bellow this code in Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "![image3](img/fibonacci_series_python.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how this algorithm works, starting always with the pair of numbers 0, 1 defined by variables a, b, if the series goes until 5, it will always perform a sum of all the previous numbers on the series, like in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image4](img/fib_series.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional way to generate the series in python starts by defining a function called `fib`, then inside of it, declaring the variables a, b equals to the first 2 numbers the series starts, 0 and 1. After that the code begins looping the numbers between `a` (means 0) and the value designed to `n`, in this case 10, so the initial pair of numbers: `a` which started as 0 becomes `b` (means 1), and the sum of `a` + `b` (means 0 + 1) = 1. This way the second pair of numbers is made 0, **1, 1**... "
